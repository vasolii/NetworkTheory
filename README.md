This project focuses on identifying communities within networks using an algorithm based on a distance quality function (Qd). Initially, the distance quality function is designed and implemented in Python. The project then explores, both mathematically and algorithmically, the sub-functions created to compute the final Qd value. It also examines the maximization function, which aims to improve the accuracy of results. The optimal communities are visualized using Gephi, and the results are compared with those derived from the modularity function. Finally, conclusions are drawn based on the analysis and comparisons of the two methods.
